### Contacts and TeamsÂ¶

https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/latest/user-guide/feature-guides/contacts-and-teams/#how-to-assign-contacts-and-teams-to-nautobot-objects
```
In order to assign contacts/teams to a particular object, we first need to define Status and Role objects for contenttype extras:contactassociation. Once that is done, we can navigate to the detail view of the object. We will use a circuit in this example.
```

Image not very helpful, and steps assume a lot of context. I tried going to a Circuit that was on demo instance and saw it had a status, but no Role on the Circuit page. Do I need to only use the API to enable that or the extras? There is no Add contact button on my GUI at the top like in the image. THere is a Contacts tab though. I can add it there, but it is midway through the page.

images are not on newlines like the rest of the page

### Custom Fields

Very good and accurate!

### Git as a Data Source

https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/latest/user-guide/feature-guides/git-data-source/#supported-providers

```
The feature uses the concept of a provides field to identify the provided data types and therefore map a repository to a use case. A list of the supported options is provided below.
```

`The feature uses` is a bit awkward and could be improved with a phrase such as This feature or The Supported Providers Feature. The links below it are helpful, but a bit more explanation of what it means by mapping a repository to a use case. There are good instructions later on how to do that, but up here is a bit confusing.
